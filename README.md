# plugin-sass

Moved to [plugin-scss](https://github.com/KevCJones/plugin-scss). I can't see the original dev wanting my hatchet work. Of course if they want it, its all over there.

If you want styles that cleanly inject into your head and a bundle that does this for you. Use [plugin-sass](https://github.com/mobilexag/plugin-sass).

If you have a need to control that css in other ways e.g. inject into Angular2 style decorators then use [plugin-scss](https://github.com/KevCJones/plugin-scss).
